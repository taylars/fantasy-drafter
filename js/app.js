/* The draft board.
 *
 * Everything on this page is derived from one thing: a Sleeper username. That
 * gives the leagues, the leagues give the drafts, the draft gives the picks and
 * the seat we're drafting from, and the projections give every player worth
 * listing. Nothing is hardcoded, nothing is loaded beforehand, and there is no
 * server — the page talks to Sleeper directly and prices the board itself.
 *
 * The one exception is the newest historical season's grades: the context no projection
 * carries — how good the offense is, how secure the role is, how many games he
 * will actually play, and how much room sits above the mean case. That is the
 * only opinion the board ships, and it is why the value column is worth more
 * than the ADP it sits next to.
