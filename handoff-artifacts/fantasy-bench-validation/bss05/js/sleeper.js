/* Read-only client for the Sleeper API.
 *
 * Docs: https://docs.sleeper.com/ — that's the source of truth, not this file.
 *
 * Runs in a browser and under Node alike: it uses nothing but `fetch`, which
 * both have had for years. That is deliberate. The board is the main caller,
 * but the grading workflow reads the same endpoints from the command line, and
 * two clients drifting apart is how the board and the research end up
 * disagreeing about who a player even is.
 *
 * Everything here is a public GET: no auth, no writes. You can read a draft but
 * cannot submit picks, set a queue, or autodraft. Stay under 1000 calls/minute.
 *
 * Gotchas worth knowing before you build on this:
 *   - There is no push API. Poll /draft/{id}/picks every 2-3s during a draft
 *     (3s = 20 calls/min, comfortably under the limit) and poll the draft
 *     object every ~30s to catch status flipping to paused/complete.
 *   - **The draft endpoints sit behind Cloudflare with `s-maxage=86400`.** Poll
 *     them plainly and you get an edge copy that can be a day old. Request
 *     `Cache-Control: no-cache` and `Pragma: no-cache` are both ignored. A
 *     unique query parameter is what gets through to the origin, which is what
 *     `fresh` adds. Sleeper's own app uses websockets and never notices this.
 *   - `draft_order` and `slot_to_roster_id` are null until the order is set.
 *   - `picked_by` is "" on autopicks — fall back to `roster_id`.
 *   - A commissioner can undo a pick, so diff on the set of `pick_no` values
 *     rather than on picks.length if you want to survive that.
 *   - Keeper leagues show picks with `is_keeper: true` before the draft starts.
 *   - Projections and ADP live on api.sleeper.app/projections/..., which is NOT
 *     in the public docs and can change without notice. getProjections wraps it.
